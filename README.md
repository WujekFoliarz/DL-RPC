# DL-RPC

Discord Rich Presence for Dying Light
How to use this:
 - Download and extract the zip
 - Launch "DL RPC.exe" before or after you launch the game, it doesn't really matter when.
 - Done, rich presence should now display on your discord profile (Keep in mind you have to launch the exe every time you want rich presence on)

After you launch the exe and the program finds Dying Light game process, the console window will dissapear and the program will run untill you exit the game.
You don't have to worry about anything since it doesn't actually inject anything into the game's process, only reads txt logs.
